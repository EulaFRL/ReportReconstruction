##################################
Medical vs. General Embeddings: Medical embeddings (from MedCAT) are specialized to represent biomedical concepts, while general embeddings (from SpaCy) are trained on broader language data.
Medical Terms: Should have significant semantic differences between MedCAT and SpaCy embeddings since MedCAT focuses on clinical contexts.
General Terms: Should have closer embeddings between the two models, as general language terms are equally well-represented in both.

High similarity: Likely a general term.
Low similarity: Likely a medical term.

OVERALL WORKFLOW
'''
    1. use cosine similarity to cross compare the medical embeddings and general embeddings for the same term
    2. thresholding, low similarity -> likely medical term, high similarity -> likely genral terms
    3. k-means clustering, then identify terms
    4. manual validation
